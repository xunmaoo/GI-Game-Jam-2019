# GI-Game-Jam-2019

The thesis of the Game Jam is "unknown" so we decided to make a RPG game that is a remake of the famous detective novel _And 
Then There Were None_ by Agatha Christie.

The player talks to all the NPCs to find the clues of their mysterious deaths. The storyline will be revealed after all clues 
being revealed.

There are slimes in the game that the player should be avoid of. Once the player is attacked, their sight will be restricted 
and the map that is visible becomes smaller.
